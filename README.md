# AEC-Modelling
DTU Alkaline electrolyser modelling built during visitng PhD period @ DTU. <br>

The objective is to build a model that can describe the polarisation curve, which depends on the settign parameters such as: <br>
- Wt% of the electrolyte, in this specific case we are talking about KOH 
- Temperature
- Operating pressure, which directly influences electrolyte density
